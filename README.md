# Baruch Underground Listing of Professor Ability

![home-page](/home_screen.png?raw=true "bulpa Homepage")

Tech Stack: Bootstrap, php, MySQL

This is the public repo for bulpa, a professor reviewing website created for [Baruch College](http://baruch.cuny.edu) students. bulpa is not affiliated with the City University of New York or Baruch College.

The concept of reviewing professors is not new (see: Rate My Professor), but having a (relatively) smaller dataset makes it easier to maintain more accurate professor names and reviews.

This project is created and maintained by [Ricky Shin](https://www.rickyshin.com).

# TODO
* Clean up unused pages, if any.
* Most Recent Review Page (add to left nav as well)
* Secure mod.php & mod-approve.php
* Google Analytics (easy/low priority)
* After site is live: push updated config.php (currently in '.gitignore' to protect reCAPTCHA API key)


# WISHLIST
* Pagination
* Bad reviewers/spammers can be shadowbanned through admin page (they will get "submitted" page but query not run.)
