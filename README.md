# Baruch Underground Listing of Professor Ability

![home-page](/home_screen.png?raw=true "bulpa Homepage")

Tech Stack: Bootstrap, php, MySQL

This is the public repo for bulpa, a professor reviewing website created for [Baruch College](http://baruch.cuny.edu) students. bulpa is not affiliated with the City University of New York or Baruch College.

The concept of reviewing professors is not new (see: Rate My Professor), but having a (relatively) smaller dataset makes it easier to maintain more accurate professor names and reviews.

Currently live at [bulpa.info](https://www.bulpa.info/).
This project is created and maintained by [Ricky Shin](https://www.rickyshin.com).
