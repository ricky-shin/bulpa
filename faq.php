            <h4>Who is this for?</h4>
            <p><a href="/index.php">bulpa</a> was created for students attending <a href="http://baruch.cuny.edu/">Baruch College</a>, in an effort to consolidate course and professor reviews found on multiple platforms.</p>    
            <h4>What kinda name is <i>bulpa</i> !?</h4>
            <p>I actually ripped it off from CULPA, which is Columbia Universtiy's professor review site.</p>
            <h4>Can I trust the reviews on this site?</h4>
            <p>You may have noticied reviews do not have contain any personally identifiable information by the submitter. Like anything you read on the Internet (unless properly sourced), take everything with a <i>grain of salt</i>.</p>
            <h4>Do you censor reviews? </h4>
            <p>I have no reason to censor any reviews. However, in an effort to display legitimate (or, seemingly legitimate) reviews, newly submitted reviews are subject to moderation. </p>
            <h4>How are you monetizing this site?</h4>
            <p>I'm not. This website was created as a side project, to fill a need.</p> 
            <h4>I'm a professor, and some things written about me are false 😠!</h4>
            <p>Please e-mail me with the [permalink] of the review (found under every review) and your name. I try my best to moderate all submissions but it's a one man show. <br />
            Fair Warning: the views expressed in the reviews on this site are those of submitters themselves, NOT of me. </p>
            <h4>Who are you?</h4>
            <p>I am a CIS student at Baruch College.</p>
