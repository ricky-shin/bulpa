                Hes nice and super passionate about literature, but his classes will drag on as he gets into tangents about biology and Greek mythology. Not a bad class if you enjoy lectures, but I zoned out most classes. Only 2 papers (5-7 pages) and 1 in-class writing assignment. Doesn't return assignments or give feedback. Good choice if you like English.

                The syllabus is not true about grading. No matter you participate or not, you final grade is just what you get for the paper. My friend and I got the same grade for the paper but I usually participated while she didn't. It turned out we still got the same final grade. It's just sad to know that the hours for class preparation were spent in vain.

                He talks too much. When he goes on a topic, he doesnt stop talking about it. The course schedule lol jokes. We didnt even go by that since he talks about the same thing for a whole month. Two papers only (5-7 pages each). He gives it back like a month later too. But if you can sit and just listen go for it.                </p>
