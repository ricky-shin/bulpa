                    <li>Find the perfect balance. Try to write more than one sentence, but you also don't need to write a novel.</li>
                    <li>Be specific. <i>Why</i> was Professor X a great professor?</li>
                    <li>Consider mentioning if textbook was required when you took the course. However please <u>don't</u> share the textbook link here.</li>
                    <li>Avoid libel. In fact, any reviews with libel will not be approved (definition of libel <a href="https://legaldictionary.net/libel/">here</a>).</li>
